Similar example is buying as it cant decide which one is more preferable to buy specific item."

One of the achievements of AI in recent years has been Alpha Go: software that beat a world champion at the game Go. I would like you to research two important game playing programmes: IBM Deep Blue and Alpha Go and how they are different. Then answer the following questions. A simple web search should reveal some useful information. If you don't know the answer to any question, feel free to go back and do some more research before finished the quiz. Firstly, what game was Deep Blue famous for playing?"
