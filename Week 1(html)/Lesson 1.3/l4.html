    <h2>Question 1
  M​achine Learning means...</h2>
  <h3>Training a statistical model based on example data</h3>
  <h2>Question 2

What is the input to a classifier?</h2>
<h3>Anything that can be represented on a  computer</h3>
<h2>Question 3

Which of these is the hardest challenge for AI?</h2>
<h3>Recognising road signs</h3>
<h2>Question 4

T​he big improvement in machine learning in recent years has been due to:</h2>
<h3>Massive increases in the amount of data available</h3>
<h2>Question 5 T​o train a machine learning model to recognise words from audio recordings of speech your data would be:</h2>
<h3>B​oth audio of speech and the corresponding written words</h3>
<hr>
<h2>A machine learning application</h2>
<h3>Describe the problem or application area?

The most problematic area is to mimic human mind or to trained them to be responsive with unique ideas.

Why is it hard for computers and why is it easier to solve for machine learning

There can be limited set of instructions but using machine learning eliminate this problems.

What data would be used as input to the machine learning algorithms?

Its depends on the area but the more data the more accuracy.

How is machine learning different from a conventional software development approach to this problem?

Software development performs sets of algorithm while ML learns from the data's to improve itself.</h3>
