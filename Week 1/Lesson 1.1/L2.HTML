    <h2><b>What makes AI hard?</b></h2>
    <h3>A​I have numbers of problems in different fields. Lets say giving logical work like, I asked to play popular song of Taylor swift but for computer all of her songs are her and good but i dont like them. I wanted AI to play specific song which was popular at while ago but it didnt know which one is so AI cant make decisons on its own. Similar example is buying as it cant decide which one is more preferable to buy specific item.</h3>

Question 1

In this quiz I would like you to do some independent research about a high profile area of AI: playing games. One of the achievements of AI in recent years has been Alpha Go: software that beat a world champion at the game Go.

I would like you to research two important game playing programmes: IBM Deep Blue and Alpha Go and how they are different. Then answer the following questions.

A simple web search should reveal some useful information. If you don't know the answer to any question, feel free to go back and do some more research before finished the quiz.

<h2>Question 4 What AI method does Alpha Go use? </h2>
<h3>Neural networks</h3>
<h2>Question 5 Why was Alpha Go able to play Go so well?</h2>
