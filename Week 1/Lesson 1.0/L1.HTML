          What do you think it is about computer vision that makes it hard for computers? How are they different from people? How could computers learn to see in the same way as people?<br>

    <h3><b>Computers generally follows sets of instructions. So basically they cant think like us or view like us, they follow the conditions which was placed to them. For example they can recognize the 2 fingers if pointed out because they knows the position only so they cant tell if its male or female or any difference. Its hard for computers vision to process every single details.</b></h3>
